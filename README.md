# Dali Members

This app lets you see the people working at DALI.

When you open the app, you find a list of all the people currently working at DALI

## Functionality

### Functionality of the List View
* You can click on someone's _Learn More_ to open their profile page
* You can click on the map marker icon to open to their location in the Map View

### Functionality of the Map View
* If you open this normally (sliding to it or clicking on the tabs), you get a worldwide view of all
the people that work at DALI right now
* If you get here by clicking on someone's specific map marker icon, it zooms directly to their 
position
* Clicking on a marker shows you an info box with their name. Clicking this info box takes
you to their profile.

### Functionality of the Profile View
* Swiping from the left opens up a navigation bar, allowing you to toggle the information about that
member that you wish to see. 
* Clicking on their _webpage_ link uses your default browser to send you to their personal webpage
* Clicking on the map marker button takes you to the map view, much like doing so from the list view
